# My .dotfiles

Thanks to [@luiswitz](https://github.com/luiswitz) that gave me a good start.

This is mostly a personal dotenvs configuration, but feel free to use it.

### Installation instructions
```bash
./install.sh STEP=1

./install.sh STEP=2
```

NOTE: Needed to split this into two steps, cause after installing zshell we were changing context and the rest of the script was not runned.

### Install iTerm Profile
Open iTerm > Preferences > Load preferences from a custom folder or URL > '/this/project/folder/iterm/iterm_profile.plist'
